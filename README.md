Diamond ML:

## Diamond Price Predictor
This project is a machine learning application designed to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and physical dimensions (depth, table, length, width, and height). It utilizes a trained model to estimate the price, allowing users to input diamond specifications and receive an accurate price prediction.This uses a seaborn dataset.

### Use Cases
Jewelry Industry: Assists jewelers in pricing diamonds accurately.
Buyers and Sellers: Helps consumers and sellers evaluate diamond prices before transactions.
Educational Purposes: Demonstrates practical applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
